# OctaNet Python Development Internship

Welcome to the repository for the Python Development Internship completed at OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd. This internship focused on developing an ATM Interface using Python for the back-end, tkinter library for the user interface, and Jupyter Notebook for documentation and exploration.

## About the Intern

**Name:** Sakshi Pawar

**Duration:** 30-60 days

**Mode:** Remote

## Project Overview

The project "ATM Interface" aimed to create a user-friendly interface for an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. The interface allows users to perform various banking operations such as:

- Viewing transaction history
- Withdrawing money
- Depositing money
- Transferring money to another user

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Used as the primary programming language for back-end logic.
- **tkinter Library:** Utilized for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Employed for documentation and code exploration.

## Repository Contents

- **`ATM_System.py`:** Contains the main Python script for running the ATM interface.
- **`README.md`:** This file, providing an overview of the internship, project, and repository.
- **`requirements.txt`:** Lists the required Python packages and their versions.
- **`LICENSE`:** License information for the repository.
- **`/screenshots`:** Directory containing screenshots of the ATM interface.
- **`/documentation`:** Directory containing any additional documentation or Jupyter Notebooks used during the internship.

## Getting Started

To run the ATM Interface:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `ATM_System.py` using Python.

## Internship Experience

During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in Python development, GUI programming with tkinter, and collaborative remote work. The project provided practical exposure to building a real-world application and enhanced my skills in problem-solving, software development, and project management.
